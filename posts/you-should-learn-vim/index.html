<p>But what I really meant to say is that you should learn neovim. I probably will
write a blog explaining why I think neovim is better than vim, but for now lets
just run with the assumption that it is.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I decided it was time to put on my big boy pants and learn vim.
This was inspired primarily by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4YTJ2W5q4Y&amp;t=3s">ThePrimagen</a> constantly emphasizing how impactful this was towards his journey
into becoming a Senior Software Engineer at Netflix. While I was skeptical for
many reasons, I decided to give it a shot. I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
<h2 id="my-previous-impressions-of-vim">My previous impressions of vim<a href="#my-previous-impressions-of-vim" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I used to view vim as an antiquated tool for old school developers who were too
stubborn to learn new tools and &ldquo;get with the times.&rdquo; I also had a faulty belief
that vim was basically just a massive circle jerk for snarky engineers with too
much free time, and not enough motivation to actually create useful systems in
the real world.</p>
<p>How wrong was I!</p>
<h2 id="why-i-think-you-should-learn-vim">Why I think you should learn vim.<a href="#why-i-think-you-should-learn-vim" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/ZwAMFIprVJAAAAAd/vim-world-vim.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>My reasons for turning from one of the biggest vim &ldquo;haters&rdquo; to a mormon level of
enthusiasm Evangelist for vim are many, but to summarize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vim will make you write more code, faster</li>
<li>Using vim &ldquo;feels&rdquo; more fun than using a mouse
<ul>
<li>Dopamine feedback cycles from learning a couple of shortcuts, and slowly
building up a repertoire of shortcuts that make you more productive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to giveup your favorite development environment
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim">vscode-neovim</a> allow you to combine the best of both worlds. Similar extensions exist for other envs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practical-advice-for-getting-started">Practical advice for getting started<a href="#practical-advice-for-getting-started" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak highly enough of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&amp;list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R">ThePrimeagen&rsquo;s vim tutorials</a>. I definitely recommend checking these out as your starting point.</p>
<p>Beyond that consider the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a vim extension for your editor of choice</li>
<li>Only learn a handful of shortcuts first
<ul>
<li>Take notes on a couple of shortcuts, and then spend an entire week using
only those shortcuts.</li>
<li>Once they become muscle memory move on to the next set of shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
