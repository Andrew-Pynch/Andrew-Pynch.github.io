# The people doing the real work

I often find myself frustrated by the lack of innovation coming out of certain
sectors of the technology industry. Amidst countless failed promises from
silicon valley startups whose valuations skyrocket despite having produce little
to no value, I often begin to feel gloomy about the prospects of of truly useful
innovations. It is when I reach these figurative low points that I go back to the
people who never fail to inspire me. These are the people who are doing the real
work. The people who constructed the infrastructure that
society continues to reap the benefits of. This is an appreciation post for those individuals and a short discussion on the impact they have had on my life.

## [Gwynne Shotwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynne_Shotwell)

Although Gwynne does not receieve as much recognition or appreciation as her
audacious CEO, she is a huge part of why SpaceX has been commercially successful.
She is extremely intelligent, calm, collected, and insanely good at executing on
complicated issues in business and engineering. She inspires me to improve my
followthrough.

## [Jim Keller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA)

There are certain people who contribute disproportionally to their fields during
their lifetimes. Jim Keller is one such individual. I don't say this to discredit
the hard work of other computer engineers, I am merely acknowledging the insane
number of contributions Jim has made to his field.

Jim is a stern believer that despite all the hoorah in the media, Moores law is
in fact not dead, but chugging along as expected due to hard work from individuals
like himself. He has held jobs at almost all of the major chip manufacturers and
played a critical part in developing the inference ASIC present in all Tesla's
with V.3 autonomy hardware.

Jim restores my hope that true innovation is still alive in transistor technology
and that there still exists engineers willing to solve hard problems. Not the type
of hard problem that involves figuring out how to use Deep Learning to get Facebook

Chris Lattner's contributions to compiler technologies can hardly be understated.
He is the original creator of the LLVm compiler infrastructure project, the Swift
programming language, and the Swift For Tensorflow deep learning framework. Whenever
I am tempted to take a break from working on a new side project or research idea,
I remember that chris lattner is probably still awake grinding out a new feature
for Swift For Tensorflow

## [Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6XcP4JOHmk)

The extremely humble Jeremy Howard is an absolute genius who is in great part
responsible for enabling the masses to utilize Deep Learning through his course
and Deep Learning framework "FastAI." Jeremy inspires me through his Feynman like approach of topdown learning. Instead of requiring wrote memorization of concepts and ideas, he is extremely focused on teaching practical applications at the top of a concept hierarchy, and then working your way down to the lowest levels of the conceptual hierarchy. This approach to learning and teaching has been extremely effective in enabling thousands of people to get a practical hands on look at how to apply deep learning to novel problems.

Additionally, a less recognized fact about Jeremy is his insane throughput. He and
Sylvan Gugger have in large part created the majority of the Fastai framework all by
themselves. They are imensely productive engineers and they both inspire me to
work harder at writing quality software that is easy for others to use and learn

I hate to bring up another individual involved in the Deep Learning world, but Francois
Chollet is another inspiration of mine that I constantly look to when considering
how I can make code that others can practically leverage. Up until recently Keras
was the dominate framework for quickly prototyping AI applications. I got my start
using Keras and was consistently blown away by how good the abstractions Francois
created were at matching my mental models. Francois's work is a lesson in writing
useable API's. By matching the mental models of most deep learning practioners,
he has enabled thousands of industry and research individuals to craft wonderful
use cases for deep learning.
