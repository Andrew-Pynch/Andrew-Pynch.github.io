# I love open source

Ever since I got my start writing code, I have fallen in love with the narrative often told in software engineering cirlces. That of how open source software has the potential to positvely impact the world. Connecting people together with codebases that solve interesting problems for free. Thousands collaborating to solve hard problems and distributing those sollutions through platforms like github. Something about that ethic stirred something deep within me.

Unfortunately, for the first couple of years of my life as a developer, I didn't feel I had anything to give back to the community. Recently however I have found enough of my projects are beginning to solve the same problems over and over again. Instead of copying and pasting these useful functions and classes over from codebase to codebase, I decided to create my first pypi package.

# Introducing scalary

Honestly, the hardest part about this was choosing that name! At first, when I started collecting all the functions and classes I was going to put in this library I named is ```vis-utils``` since its mainly a collection of handy functions for doing quick and dirty image processing for feeding into reinforcement learning algorithms. Unforunately when I went to publish onto PyPi that name was already taken :-(

After choosing the name from [Random Word.com](https://randomword.com/), the rest was easy.
I won't bore with the technical details, but I personally used this excellent tutorial to learn how to set up my repo for publishing to PyPi

# Thoughts
Although scalary only has a single class for doing some useful data collection stuff, I am excited to find more of the countless one off useful functions I have written and integrating it into the library. 

Regardless of how useful this library turns out to be to anyone, it was fun to learn how to publish my own package. I am looking forward to building more cool stuff like this in the future :-)

Cheers!
